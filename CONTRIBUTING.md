## üíª Coding Standards

### TypeScript

**General Rules:**
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Avoid `any` types - use proper typing
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use type aliases for unions and primitives
- Export types when needed by other modules

**Example:**
```typescript
// Good ‚úÖ
interface UserProfile {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
  createdAt: Date
}

function getUser(id: string): Promise<UserProfile | null> {
  // implementation
}

// Bad ‚ùå
function getUser(id: any): any {
  // implementation
}
```

### React Components

**Component Structure:**
```typescript
import { ComponentProps } from '@/types/components'

interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string
  onAction?: () => void
}

export function MyComponent({ title, onAction }: MyComponentProps) {
  // Implementation
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* JSX */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use functional components
- Use React hooks appropriately
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract logic into custom hooks
- Use server components by default (add 'use client' only when needed)
- Avoid prop drilling - use context or composition

### File Naming

- **Components:** PascalCase - `UserProfile.tsx`
- **Pages:** kebab-case - `user-settings/page.tsx`
- **Utilities:** camelCase - `formatDate.ts`
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE - `API_ENDPOINTS.ts`

### Code Organization

**Import Order:**
```typescript
// 1. React and Next.js
import { useState } from 'react'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

// 2. Third-party libraries
import { z } from 'zod'

// 3. Local imports
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { formatDate } from '@/lib/utils'
import type { User } from '@/types/database'

// 4. Styles (if any)
import styles from './component.module.css'
```

### Styling

**Tailwind CSS:**
- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Extract repeated patterns into components
- Use design system colors/spacing

**Example:**
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4 p-6 md:flex-row md:gap-6 lg:p-8">
  <Button className="w-full md:w-auto">
    Click me
  </Button>
</div>
```

### Comments and Documentation

**When to comment:**
- Complex logic that isn't immediately obvious
- Business rules or calculations
- Workarounds or non-obvious solutions
- API contracts and data structures

**JSDoc for functions:**
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the user's reputation score based on their activity
 * 
 * @param userId - The unique identifier for the user
 * @param includeBonus - Whether to include seasonal bonuses
 * @returns The calculated reputation score
 */
export async function calculateReputationScore(
  userId: string,
  includeBonus = false
): Promise<number> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Error Handling

**Always handle errors gracefully:**
```typescript
try {
  const result = await riskyOperation()
  return result
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error)
  // Show user-friendly error
  return { error: 'Something went wrong. Please try again.' }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests (When Implemented)

**Test file naming:** `component.test.tsx` or `utils.test.ts`

**Test structure:**
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent'

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('renders the title', () => {
    render(<MyComponent title="Test Title" />)
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Title')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('calls onAction when button is clicked', () => {
    const onAction = jest.fn()
    render(<MyComponent title="Test" onAction={onAction} />)
    
    const button = screen.getByRole('button')
    button.click()
    
    expect(onAction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  })
})
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >80% coverage on new code
- Focus on critical paths first
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Don't test implementation details
